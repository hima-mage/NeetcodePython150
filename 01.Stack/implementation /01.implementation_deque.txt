# Deque (Doubly Ended Queue) in Python is implemented using the module “collections“.
 Deque is preferred over a list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends of the container,
 as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to a list that provides O(n) time complexity.






# Types of Restricted Deque Input
Input Restricted Deque:  Input is limited at one end while deletion is permitted at both ends.
Output Restricted Deque: output is limited at one end but insertion is permitted at both ends.


#

        from collections import deque

        # Declaring deque
        queue = deque(['name','age','DOB'])

        print(queue)


# Appending Items Efficiently
append():- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the right end of the deque.
appendleft():- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the left end of the deque.


# Popping Items Efficiently
pop():- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of the deque.
popleft():- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of the deque.


# Accessing Items in a deque
index(ele, beg, end):- This function returns the first index of the value mentioned in arguments, starting searching from beg till end index.
insert(i, a) :- This function inserts the value mentioned in arguments(a) at index(i) specified in arguments.
remove():- This function removes the first occurrence of the value mentioned in arguments.
count():- This function counts the number of occurrences of value mentioned in arguments.


# Different operations on deque
    extend(iterable):- This function is used to add multiple values at the right end of the deque. The argument passed is iterable.
    extendleft(iterable):- This function is used to add multiple values at the left end of the deque.
     The argument passed is iterable. Order is reversed as a result of left appends.
    reverse():- This function is used to reverse the order of deque elements.
    rotate():- This function rotates the deque by the number specified in arguments.
     If the number specified is negative, rotation occurs to the left. Else rotation is to right.
