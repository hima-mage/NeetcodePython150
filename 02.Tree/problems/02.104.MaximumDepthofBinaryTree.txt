https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


 2.Depth of a node: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to the path. So,
     it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node.
